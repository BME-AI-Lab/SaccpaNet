# Overall principle

## Overall

1. [ ] The code should straightly contains necessary code
2. [ ] Update the pytorch-lightning version to latest
3. [ ] All codes has documentations.
4. [ ] Codes should contains some sort of checking
5. [ ] If it uses others code, it should be contained in seperate
6. [ ] Breaks large python files in to smaller pieces
7. [ ] Need a readme
8. [ ] Procedural codes are started by XX_*.py, which XX is a two digit code

## Process management

1. [ ] Convergence check

## What to do with un-needed code?

### Calassificaiton of uneed code by 4 domain

|            | Important                          | Un-important                         |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Urgent     | Do imediately                      | reformat                             |
| Non-urgent | Place marker for check/ Check list | Throw in a old folder and do not use |

1. Put into a folder hightligted needd


## How can I ensure that everything still works? 

### Automatical testing 
1. [ ] Is there some kind of automatic checker that visual studio runs by default on save ? 
2. [ ] Aut h
